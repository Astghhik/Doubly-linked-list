# Doubly-linked-list
Doubly Linked List in C++ is very similar to a linked list, except that each node also contains a pointer to the node previous to the current one.
This means that in a doubly linked list in C++ we can travel not only in the forward direction, but also in the backward direction, which was not possible with a palin linked list in C++.

    Data: Information that the linked list contains.
    "*"prev: Pointer to the previous node.
    "*"next: Pointer to the next node.
